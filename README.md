# Angular-Application

Tools used to develop this application
    1.	Angular-CLI – The CLI is a great tool for big Angular projects. It allows you to focus on Angular code instead of workflow tasks!
    2.	Node.js
    3.	Sublime Text Editor
    4.	Firebase 

Since I used the Mac for the application development, I am sharing all the commands required for the project set up. 
    •	To install Angular- CLI – npm install -g @angular/cli
    •	To create a new project – ng new (application name)
    •	Use terminal to access the created folder and then use command – ng serve to start the server
    •	User the configured port to launch your application.
